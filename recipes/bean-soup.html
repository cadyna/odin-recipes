        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p><em>Military bean soup</em>  is one of the easiest and most filling recipes a person can make, often feeding up to a family of four to six people.</p>
        <p><strong>Beans</strong> are versatile legumes and pair well with numerous vegetables, meaning you could put anything in the soup and come out equally satisfied. </p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>beans - <em>1 kg</em></li>
            <li>celery - <em>70 g</em></li>
            <li>onion - <em>500 g</em></li>
            <li>carrot - <em>500 g</em></li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>bell pepper - <em>2 large pieces</em></li>
            <li> ground pepper - <em>teaspoon</em></li>
            <li>tomato - <em>2 large pieces</em></li>
            <li>water - <em>5 L</em></li>
            <li>garlic - <em>4-5 cloves</em></li>
            <li>flour (smooth)- <em>70 g</em></li>
            <li>paprika (sweet) - <em>20 g</em></li>
            <li>spice mix - <em>teaspoon</em></li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Soak the beans overnight in cold water.</li>
            <li>Strain and put to boil in new water. As soon as they boil, boil the beans for only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Discard the water, wash and set aside until ready to use. In a little fat, oil or a combination of both, sauté the hot peppers, chopped onion, carrot, root vegetables, celery and parsley, all according to the amount specified at the top of the page or in the video recipe. Sauté for 20 minutes until golden yellow.</li>
            <li>Now add the chopped cured meat products in medium-sized pieces, not too large and not too small.</li>
            <li>Simmer everything together for about fifteen minutes, the smoked cured meat will nicely release its fat and juices, so the onion, carrot and root vegetables will be even better and more qualitatively stewed (braised).</li>
            <li>Now add and pour in only half a liter of water. This is so that the beans don't stick to the bottom of the pan while you add the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, tomatoes cut in half, the bell pepper and the beans that you drained after boiling.</li>
            <li>Now pour in 4.5 liters of water.</li>
            <li>As soon as it boils, cook for the next 20 minutes but stir from time to time because at this stage the beans are heavy, not yet cooked, fall to the bottom and stick easily.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, take out the tomatoes and peel them. Cut them with a knife into smaller pieces and put them back into the soup.</li>
            <li>After an hour, add salt to taste or add spice mixtures if necessary and mix.</li>
            <li>In a pan, melt and heat the fat, the oil mixture, both and add the chopped garlic. Don't fry the garlic for long so that it doesn't burn, just stir for about ten seconds and add the flour and sweet paprika.</li>
            <li>Continue to stir and fry for about half a minute and then add to the dish and mix well. Let it cook for another 5 minutes, then add a lot of chopped fresh parsley leaves and stir.</li>
